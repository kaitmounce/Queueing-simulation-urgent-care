# Queueing-simulation-urgent-care-with-reneging

## Overview

This project simulates an M/M/1 queuing system using MATLAB. The model 
represents an urgent care facility where patients arrive randomly and 
receive service from a single doctor. 

## Baseline Model

The original model assumes:
- Customers arrive according to a Poisson process (rate λ)
- Service times are exponentially distributed (rate μ)
- All customers remain in the system until they are served
This baseline is used to compute theoretical and simulated values for:
- $P_n$ (probability of n customers in system)
- $L$ , $L_q$, $W$, $W_q$

## Reneging
The model was extended to include reneging, where customers may leave the queue before getting served.

### Key Changes:
- Added a new `Renege` event class
- Created `ServiceQueueRenege` class (modified version of `ServiceQueue`)
- Introduced:
- `RenegeRate (θ)`
- Scheduled a reneging event for each waiting customer
- Implemented `handle_renege` method to remove impatient customers
- Updated logging to track:
- Number of customers reneged per shift

## Simulation results
With reneging:
- Queue lengths decrease
- Waiting times decrease
- Total time in system decreases
- Fewer customers are served (lost demand)

## Files for running

### Core Classes:
- `ServiceQueue.m` → baseline queue simulation
- `ServiceQueueRenege.m` → queue with reneging
- `Arrival.m`, `Departure.m`, `Renege.m` → event handling

### Simulation Scripts:
- `Run_ServiceQueue_baseline.m`
- Computes theoretical values
- Runs baseline simulation
- Generates histograms and performance metrics
- `Run_ServiceQueueRenege.m`
- Runs simulation with reneging
- Computes $P_n$ and $\pi_n$
- Generates histograms:
- number in system
- waiting time
- service time
- customers served
- customers reneged

## Extra Notes
- The system is modeled as an event-driven simulation
- Time is tracked continuously
- Results are based on multiple simulated 8-hour shifts
- "Queueing" spelling follows textbook convention
